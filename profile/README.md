# Welcome to the Exousia Partnership
This is a partnership of over (currently) 50 different companies in multiple industries that have come together for there own personal goals and also partership wide goals. The GitHub account is used for partnership wide projects or for use by the Training Command. Please note that the Partnership itself is developing currently and will not be online for a long time. You may notice some repositories.

## Training Command (TECOM)
The Training Command is the Partnership wide training and recruiting command that will hire, select and filter recruits for its member organisations and companies. They have multiple programs and extensive staff, hierarchies and curriculum to teach your recruits. Additionally, they work (in the Partnership) with the Anti Corruption department and Justice Affairs to filter out any bad people or recruits. As an member you can also specify your own curriculum if you want otherwise one can be made for you. Please note that staff will not always be "hands on" with the recruit and will usually only provide the services for recruits to read the lessons and do the lessons online. If you want to learn more about the partnership there is a seperate GitHub organisation [[here]].
